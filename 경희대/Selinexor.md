Selinexor Cmax and AUC increased proportionally over a dose range from 3 mg/m² to 85 mg/m² (0.05 to 1.44 times the maximum approved recommended dose, based on 1.7 m² body surface area). No clinically relevant accumulation at steady state was observed. Selinexor Cmax and AUC₀-∞ after administration of a single dose of XPOVIO in patients with hematologic malignancies are presented in Table.
